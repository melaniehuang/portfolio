  				<h4>About</a></h4>
  				<p>Four Letter Word Theatre with an increased focus on new works and access were determined to test ways in which we could reinvent captions within the art direction and stage design of a play. With a small access grant, they set off to find a way.</p><p>We collaborated on a captioning system which integrated itself as part of the set and provided not only one captioned show but all four, with an opportunity for audiences to attend a tactile tour before the relaxed performance on the Thursday night.</p><p>The set projections told the story of the play but also brought out the ever present tension. With the physical haze as our inspiration, and the fact that the relaxed performance couldn‚Äôt have haze, we decided to create a dynamic, living, breathing haze that would act as a metaphor of Hexate, Ira‚Äôs inner voice.</p>
